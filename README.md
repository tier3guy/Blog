}
```
````

## 🎨 Customization

### Adding New Tags/Categories

Simply add them to your blog post frontmatter. The system automatically generates tag pages.

### Featured Posts

Set `featured: true` in your blog post frontmatter to highlight it on the homepage (you can create a dedicated feature section in the home page).

### Styling

The project uses Tailwind CSS with a custom design system. Modify styles in:

- `app/globals.css` - Global styles
- Individual component files - Component-specific styles

### For Authors

Add your author details to the `lib/authors.ts` file.

```tsx
// lib/authors.ts
export const authors: Record<string, Author> = {
  dillion: {
    name: "Dillion Verma",
    position: "Software Engineer",
    avatar: "/authors/dillion.png",
  },
  arghya: {
    name: "Arghya Das",
    position: "Design System Engineer",
    avatar: "/authors/arghya.png",
  },
  // Add your author details here
  yourname: {
    name: "Your Full Name",
    position: "Your Position/Title",
    avatar: "/authors/your-avatar.png",
  },
} as const;
```

Then reference your author in blog posts using the key (e.g., `author: "yourname"`).

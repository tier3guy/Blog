# ðŸ§± Resume Builder â€” Builder (System Design Question â€” Solution)

This document is a solution write-up for the system design question: implement a Resume Builder where resume creation follows a step-by-step process. It presents the problem, a practical TypeScript implementation using the Builder pattern, usage examples, and notes on production considerations.

---

## Problem â€” Resume Builder (Builder use-case)

Building a resume involves collecting and organizing various pieces of information in a structured way. The requirements for a robust resume builder are:

- Support step-by-step construction of complex resume objects
- Allow different types of resumes to be built using the same construction process
- Provide methods to:
  - Set personal information (name, contact details)
  - Add educational background
  - Add work experiences
  - Add skills and projects
  - Build the final resume object
- Keep the construction process flexible and independent of how the resume parts are assembled

**Why does this map well to the Builder pattern?**

- Resume creation involves multiple steps with different types of data
- The construction process should be independent of how the resume is represented
- Different types of resumes might need different representations
- The pattern allows fine control over the construction process

---

### Example Inputs (for the tutorial)

A TypeScript interface defining the Resume Builder contract:

```ts
export interface IResumeBuilder {
    setName(name: string): IResumeBuilder;
    setContactInfo(contactMethod: TContactMethod, contactValue: string): IResumeBuilder;
    setEducation(education: TEducation): IResumeBuilder;
    setExperience(experience: TExperience): IResumeBuilder;
    setSkill(skill: string): IResumeBuilder;
    setProject(project: TProject): IResumeBuilder;
    build(): TResume;
}
```

And the supporting types:

```ts
export type TContactMethod = "Mail" | "Phone" | "Address";
export type TEducation = {
    institute: string;
    fromYear: number;
    toYear: number | "Present";
    cgpa?: number;
};
export type TExperience = {
    company: string;
    designation: string;
    description?: string;
    fromYear: number;
    toYear: number | "Present";
};
```

(You can find these in the example `utils.ts` in the exercise folder.)

## Solution â€” TypeScript Builder Resume Manager

We'll implement the following classes:

- **ProfessionalResumeBuilder:** Concrete builder implementing the resume construction steps
- **Client:** Example usage of the builder pattern

### Key Design Choices

- Builder interface defining all necessary steps for resume construction
- Method chaining for a fluent builder interface
- Flexible resume structure allowing optional fields
- Immutable final resume object

---

### ðŸ§© Implementation (Concise, Annotated)

```ts
export class ProfessionalResumeBuilder implements IResumeBuilder {
    private resume: TResume;

    public constructor() {
        this.resume = {
            name: '',
            contacts: [],
            educations: [],
            experiences: [],
            skills: [],
            projects: []
        };
    }

    public setName(name: string): IResumeBuilder {
        this.resume.name = name;
        return this;
    }

    public setContactInfo(contactMethod: TContactMethod, contactValue: string): IResumeBuilder {
        this.resume.contacts.push({
            method: contactMethod,
            value: contactValue
        });
        return this;
    }

    public setEducation(education: TEducation): IResumeBuilder {
        this.resume.educations.push(education);
        return this;
    }

    // ... other builder methods ...

    public build(): TResume {
        return this.resume;
    }
}
```

---

### ðŸ§  Usage Example

```ts
const resumeBuilder = new ProfessionalResumeBuilder();

const resume = resumeBuilder
    .setName("Avinash Gupta")
    .setContactInfo("Phone", "+91 99999 99999")
    .setContactInfo("Mail", "hello.avinash@zohomail.in")
    .setEducation({
        institute: "Narula Institute of Technology",
        fromYear: 2020,
        toYear: 2024,
        cgpa: 9.21
    })
    .setExperience({
        company: "Infosys",
        designation: "Specialist Programmer L1",
        fromYear: 2024,
        toYear: "Present",
    })
    .setSkill("NodeJS")
    .setSkill("NextJS")
    .setSkill("LLD")
    .build();

console.log(resume);
```

## Notes, Edge-Cases & Alternatives

- **Validation:** Add validation in setter methods to ensure data consistency
- **Immutability:** Consider making the final resume object immutable using Object.freeze()
- **Multiple builders:** Create different builders for different resume formats (academic, professional, creative)
- **Optional steps:** Allow skipping optional sections while maintaining a valid resume structure
- **Error handling:** Implement proper error handling for required fields and invalid data
- **Template support:** Consider adding predefined template methods in the builder class
- **Testing:** Test different construction sequences and validate the final resume structure

## âœ… Conclusion

The Builder pattern excels at creating complex objects step by step, making it perfect for a resume builder implementation. The TypeScript example demonstrates how to create a flexible, maintainable solution that separates the construction process from the representation.

The pattern's benefits shine through in:
- Step-by-step construction with clear method names
- Support for different resume formats through different builders
- Clean separation between construction and representation
- Easy extension for new resume sections or formats

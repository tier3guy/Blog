# üß± Creational Design Patterns ‚Äî Explained with Real-World Scenarios

Creational design patterns are like **blueprints for object creation** ‚Äî they help you manage how objects are instantiated, ensuring your code is flexible, scalable, and easier to maintain.

Let‚Äôs explore all **five** creational design patterns, not just with toy examples ‚Äî but through **real-world coding scenarios** you‚Äôll actually encounter as a developer.

## üß© 1. Singleton Pattern ‚Äî One Instance to Rule Them All

Imagine your app needs a **single configuration loader** that reads environment variables or a config file. This object is expensive to create and must be shared globally.

That‚Äôs the **Singleton Pattern**.

It ensures that only **one instance** of a class exists and provides a **global access point** to it. This is useful for shared resources like configuration managers, logging systems, or caching mechanisms.

However, because it introduces **global state**, Singleton can make testing and parallelism harder. Use it **only when a single shared instance is truly needed**.

Here‚Äôs a practical TypeScript example:

```ts
class AppConfig {
  private static instance: AppConfig;
  private config: Record<string, string> = {};

  private constructor() {
    console.log("Loading configuration...");
    this.config = {
      apiUrl: process.env.API_URL || "https://api.myapp.com",
      env: process.env.NODE_ENV || "production",
    };
  }

  public static getInstance(): AppConfig {
    if (!AppConfig.instance) {
      AppConfig.instance = new AppConfig();
    }
    return AppConfig.instance;
  }

  public get(key: string) {
    return this.config[key];
  }
}

// Usage
const config1 = AppConfig.getInstance();
const config2 = AppConfig.getInstance();
console.log(config1 === config2); // true
```

In multithreaded systems, ensure proper **synchronization or lazy initialization** for thread safety.

## üè≠ 2. Factory Method Pattern ‚Äî Delegating Object Creation

Picture this: you‚Äôre building a **notification system** that can send emails, SMS, or push notifications. The type of notification depends on user preference.

You could use `if`/`else` blocks everywhere ‚Äî or you could let the **Factory Method Pattern** handle object creation.

The Factory Method defines an interface for creating objects but lets **subclasses decide which class to instantiate**.

This makes the system open for extension but closed for modification ‚Äî a core **SOLID principle**.

```ts
interface Notification {
  send(message: string): void;
}

class EmailNotification implements Notification {
  send(message: string) {
    console.log(`üìß Sending Email: ${message}`);
  }
}

class SMSNotification implements Notification {
  send(message: string) {
    console.log(`üì± Sending SMS: ${message}`);
  }
}

abstract class NotificationFactory {
  abstract createNotification(): Notification;

  notifyUser(message: string) {
    const notification = this.createNotification();
    notification.send(message);
  }
}

class EmailFactory extends NotificationFactory {
  createNotification() {
    return new EmailNotification();
  }
}

class SMSFactory extends NotificationFactory {
  createNotification() {
    return new SMSNotification();
  }
}

// Usage
const factory = new EmailFactory();
factory.notifyUser("Welcome to our app!");
```

Use it when your system must decide object type **at runtime**. The pitfall? Too many small factories can increase code complexity ‚Äî use wisely.

## üèóÔ∏è 3. Abstract Factory Pattern ‚Äî Families of Related Objects

Now, imagine you‚Äôre developing a **UI library** that supports both **light** and **dark themes**. Each theme has its own buttons, cards, and modals ‚Äî but they must look consistent.

You can‚Äôt just create these objects randomly. You need a **factory that produces families of related objects**.

That‚Äôs the **Abstract Factory Pattern**.

It provides an interface for creating related objects without specifying their concrete classes.

```ts
interface Button {
  render(): void;
}
interface Card {
  display(): void;
}

class LightButton implements Button {
  render() {
    console.log("Rendering Light Button ‚òÄÔ∏è");
  }
}
class DarkButton implements Button {
  render() {
    console.log("Rendering Dark Button üåë");
  }
}

class LightCard implements Card {
  display() {
    console.log("Displaying Light Card ‚òÄÔ∏è");
  }
}
class DarkCard implements Card {
  display() {
    console.log("Displaying Dark Card üåë");
  }
}

interface ThemeFactory {
  createButton(): Button;
  createCard(): Card;
}

class LightThemeFactory implements ThemeFactory {
  createButton() {
    return new LightButton();
  }
  createCard() {
    return new LightCard();
  }
}

class DarkThemeFactory implements ThemeFactory {
  createButton() {
    return new DarkButton();
  }
  createCard() {
    return new DarkCard();
  }
}

// Usage
function renderUI(factory: ThemeFactory) {
  const button = factory.createButton();
  const card = factory.createCard();
  button.render();
  card.display();
}

renderUI(new DarkThemeFactory());
```

Use this when you need **consistent families of objects** that should work together.  
Pitfall: adding new product types (like sliders) requires updating all factories.

## üß∞ 4. Builder Pattern ‚Äî Constructing Complex Objects Step by Step

You‚Äôre designing a **house builder app** where users can configure rooms, floors, pools, and gardens.  
A constructor with dozens of parameters is messy ‚Äî this is where **Builder Pattern** shines.

The Builder lets you **construct complex objects step by step**. It‚Äôs especially useful when creating objects that require many configurations.

```ts
class House {
  rooms: number = 0;
  hasGarden: boolean = false;
  hasPool: boolean = false;

  describe() {
    console.log(
      `House with ${this.rooms} rooms, ${
        this.hasGarden ? "a garden" : "no garden"
      }, and ${this.hasPool ? "a pool" : "no pool"}.`
    );
  }
}

class HouseBuilder {
  private house: House;

  constructor() {
    this.house = new House();
  }

  addRooms(n: number) {
    this.house.rooms = n;
    return this;
  }

  addGarden() {
    this.house.hasGarden = true;
    return this;
  }

  addPool() {
    this.house.hasPool = true;
    return this;
  }

  build() {
    return this.house;
  }
}

// Usage
const villa = new HouseBuilder().addRooms(5).addGarden().addPool().build();
villa.describe();
```

When to use: when object construction involves **optional parameters** or **multiple configurations**.  
Pitfall: increases code size due to many builder classes.

## üß¨ 5. Prototype Pattern ‚Äî Cloning Instead of Building

Consider a game engine that spawns **enemy units**. Each unit has complex configurations (AI, health, weapons).  
Creating every unit from scratch would be expensive. So, you **clone an existing prototype** instead.

That‚Äôs the **Prototype Pattern** ‚Äî it lets you copy existing objects without depending on their exact classes.

```ts
interface EnemyPrototype {
  clone(): EnemyPrototype;
}

class Enemy implements EnemyPrototype {
  constructor(
    public type: string,
    public health: number,
    public weapon: string
  ) {}

  clone(): EnemyPrototype {
    return new Enemy(this.type, this.health, this.weapon);
  }
}

// Usage
const baseEnemy = new Enemy("Orc", 100, "Axe");
const enemy1 = baseEnemy.clone();
const enemy2 = baseEnemy.clone();
console.log(enemy1, enemy2);
```

Use it when creating an object is **costly or complex**.  
Pitfall: deep vs shallow copy confusion ‚Äî always ensure correct clone behavior.

## üß≠ Final Thoughts

Creational design patterns are the foundation for scalable software architecture.

They help you:

- Simplify complex object creation
- Avoid tightly coupled constructors
- Promote code reusability and testability

Mastering these five patterns ‚Äî **Singleton, Factory Method, Abstract Factory, Builder, and Prototype** ‚Äî gives you the tools to design cleaner, more adaptable systems.
